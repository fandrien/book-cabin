# Book Cabin

A Go-based flight search aggregator that collects flight data concurrently from multiple airline providers, normalizes the responses into a unified model, and returns the best available results with filtering, sorting and caching.

## Features

* Concurrent search across multiple airline providers
* Provider pattern for easy extensibility
* DTO → Domain Model mapping
* Generic JSON loader
* Aggregation layer
* In-memory cache
* Filtering
* Sorting
* Best Value ranking algorithm
* Request validation
* Partial failure handling
* Context propagation
* Provider timeout

---

# Supported Providers

* Garuda Indonesia
* Lion Air
* AirAsia
* Batik Air

Each provider has:

* DTO
* Mapper
* Provider implementation
* Mock JSON response

# Available Filters

| Filter           | Description         |
| ---------------- | ------------------- |
| origin           | Origin airport      |
| destination      | Destination airport |
| departureDate    | Departure date      |
| arrivalDate      | Arrival date        |
| returnDate       | Return date         |
| airlines         | Filter by airlines  |
| minPrice         | Min Price           |
| maxPrice         | Max Price           |
| minDuration      | Min Flight Duration |
| maxDuration      | Max Flight Duration |
| stops            | Number of stops     |

# Sorting

Supported sorting fields

* best (default)
* price
* duration
* departure
* arrival

Supported order

* asc
* desc

---

## Best Value Algorithm

If no sorting option is specified, flights are ranked using a custom Best Value algorithm.

The score combines:

- Ticket price (lower is better)
- Total travel duration (shorter is better)
- Number of stops (fewer stops are strongly preferred)

Flights with fewer stops receive a significant advantage, making direct flights rank higher whenever possible.

The flight with the lowest score is considered the best value.

---

# Caching

Search results are cached in memory.

Cache key is generated from the search request parameters.

Benefits:

* Faster repeated searches
* Reduced provider calls
* Lower response time

---

# Timeout

Each provider request is executed with its own timeout using Go Context.

If a provider exceeds the configured timeout:

* The provider is marked as failed.
* Other providers continue processing.
* Partial results are still returned.

---

# Partial Failure

The system tolerates provider failures.

Example:

```
Garuda     ✅

Lion       ✅

AirAsia    ❌ Timeout

Batik      ✅
```

The API still returns available flights from successful providers.

---

# Validation

The following validations are performed:

* Origin is required
* Destination is required
* Origin cannot equal destination
* Departure date format validation
* Return date format validation
* Return date cannot be earlier than departure date

---

# Concurrency

Provider searches run concurrently using:

* Goroutines
* sync.WaitGroup
* sync.Mutex

This reduces overall search latency.

---

# Technologies

* Go
* net/http
* Context
* Goroutines
* WaitGroup
* Mutex
* JSON
* Generic Functions
